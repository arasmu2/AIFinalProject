Proposal is to build an AI that can play Wordle on the NY Times website, by interacting with the elements of the page.

The project plans to use Python, and the Selenium library to interact with the site.

Early work will go into probing the site to find which words are in the list of acceptable guesses.  A tree will be used, with a null node, that will branch 26 times at each level, such that the level number is the position of the letter.  When probing, any leaf or even branch, that is determined to not be part of a valid guess will be eliminated.  

After this list is determined.  Each game will use a copy of the list, and depending on the search pattern will traverse the tree for each attempt.  If a letter is determined to not be part of the solution for that day, it will be pruned from the tree.  If a letter is in the puzzle, but in the wrong location, all nodes with that letter, at that depth will be removed, and depending on the search heuristic, will be given additional weight such that it must be tried in another location.  If a letter is determined to be in the correct position, then all other options at that depth will be removed.

Search patterns:

One pattern could be a depth first pattern, modified to give letters that are in the solution, but in the wrong position preference.

Another could choose the next letter based on the additional branches from that node, or even all nodes in its subtrees.  The "All Nodes" idea will take more time to process, but may produce better results when guessing.  It is possible that having so many choices could mean a higher failure.

Also consider giving vowels higher weight, until they pruned from the tree.

Also consider first guess being at random, or with some randomness, giving weight to words that have more diversity in vowels.
